# GHS Tracking analyses
This repository contains descriptions of GHS Tracking analyses and the code needed to perform them. Where applicable, artifacts representing the analyses outputs are included.

## Getting started
To run many of the analyses, access to the GHS Tracking database server is required, and to use many of the provided terminal commands, a configured `~/.pg_service.conf` file is required. See below for how to set these up.

## Running analyses
The directory `[analyses](./analyses/)` contains one directory per analysis. Each of those contains a `README.md` detailing the analysis and providing instructions for how to run it, if possible.
